DMI TYPES
The SMBIOS specification defines the following DMI types:

Type   Information
────────────────────────────────────────────
	0   BIOS
	1   System
	2   Baseboard
	3   Chassis
	4   Processor
	5   Memory Controller
	6   Memory Module
	7   Cache
	8   Port Connector
	9   System Slots

	10   On Board Devices
	11   OEM Strings
	12   System Configuration Options
	13   BIOS Language
	14   Group Associations
	15   System Event Log
	16   Physical Memory Array
	17   Memory Device
	18   32-bit Memory Error
	19   Memory Array Mapped Address
	20   Memory Device Mapped Address
	21   Built-in Pointing Device
	22   Portable Battery
	23   System Reset 
	24   Hardware Security
	25   System Power Controls
	26   Voltage Probe
	27   Cooling Device
	28   Temperature Probe
	29   Electrical Current Probe
	30   Out-of-band Remote Access
	31   Boot Integrity Services
	32   System Boot
	33   64-bit Memory Error
	34   Management Device
	35   Management Device Component
	36   Management Device Threshold Data
	37   Memory Channel
	38   IPMI Device
	39   Power Supply
	40   Additional Information
	41   Onboard Devices Extended Information
	42   Management Controller Host Interface

Additionally,  type  126  is used for disabled entries and type 127 is an end-of-table marker. Types 128 to 255 are
for OEM-specific data.  dmidecode will display these entries by default, but it can only decode them when the  ven‐
dors have contributed documentation or code for them.

			Keywords can be used instead of type numbers with --type.  Each keyword is equivalent to a list of type numbers:

Keyword     Types
──────────────────────────────
bios        0, 13
system      1, 12, 15, 23, 32
baseboard   2, 10, 41
chassis     3
processor   4
memory      5, 6, 16, 17
cache       7
connector   8
slot        9

Keywords are matched case-insensitively. The following command lines are equivalent:

• dmidecode --type 0 --type 13

• dmidecode --type 0,13

• dmidecode --type bios

• dmidecode --type BIOS
